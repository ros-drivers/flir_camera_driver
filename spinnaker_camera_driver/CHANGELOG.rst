  * Switched order of configuration to put ISP enable next to color encoding
  * Updated config to include enumeration for Off, Once, Continuous parameters, and udpated diagnostics.launch
  * Handled issue where no namespace prevents diagnostics_agg from loading from analyzer paramaters
* Branch to Support GigE Cameras (`#79 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/79>`_)
  * Changes required to use GigE Blackfly S version
  * Update SpinnakerCamera.cpp
* Add new parameter to apply an offset to image time stamps (`#56 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/56>`_)

  * fixes error on destroying SpinnakerCamera with multiple cameras
  * adds clarifying comment
* Add /opt/spinnaker to spinnaker discovery options (`#63 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/63>`_)
* increase maximum value of exposure_time/auto_exposure_time_upper_limit (`#55 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/55>`_)
* add option to set queue_size for ros publisher (`#54 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/54>`_)

* Feature: horizontal and vertical image reverse (`#41 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/41>`_)
  * Add horizontal/vertical inverse to reconfigure cfg
  * Add ReverseX/ReverseY with setProperty
  Co-authored-by: Fabian Schilling <fabian.schilling@me.com>
* Update Spinnaker.cfg (`#50 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/50>`_)
  Fix for correct spelling with capital letter for bool type
* Add auto exposure ROI parameters (`#52 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/52>`_)
  * spinnaker_camera_driver: setProperty: report available enum values
  Only done on failure. This helps to figure out which enum values are
  available on a particular camera model.
  * spinnaker_camera_driver: expose AE ROI parameters
  This is highly useful when using fisheye lenses, which illuminate only
  a circle in the center of the image. The AE gets confused by the black
  regions around it and overexposes the image.
  This also exposes the "AutoExposureLightingMode" parameter, which allows
  the user to choose a lighting preset (front/back/normal).
* Fix/frame rate params (`#20 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/20>`_)
  * [spinnaker_camera_driver] Fixed naming of frame rate control params
  * [spinnaker_camera_driver] Format of mono and stereo launchfiles
  * [spinnaker_camera_driver] Updated diagnostics launchfile
* Removed opencv as depend. (`#46 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/46>`_)
* Changed the download script to check for destination folder and moved unpack directory. (`#44 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/44>`_)
* Merge pull request `#42 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/issues/42>`_ from civerachb-cpr/rpsw-185
  Fix Flycap & Spinnaker endpoints
* Create the directory if it doesn't exist
* Remove an unnecessary deb
* Spinnaker driver now successfully downloads & builds
* Start overhauling the spinnaker download script so it works with the correct endpoint & matches the general structure of the pointgrey_camera_driver
