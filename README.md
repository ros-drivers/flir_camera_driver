# flir_camera_driver

This repository contains packages for FlirImaging's line of cameras. This repositories intent is to make use of Flir's newly developed SDK: Spinnaker. The camera driver is an evolution of pointgrey_camera_driver. It has been updated to use the new methods provided by the SDK.

## Packages

### Spinnaker Camera Driver

The camera driver supports USB3 and GIGE cameras are planned. Note thats support for FireWire cameras is dropped in this SDK. The driver has been tested with a Blackfly S and Chameleon 3 camera. Differences between cameras requires that each camera model needs a customized interface class. If your camera type is not included, consider contributing the interface by referring to the section bellow.

##### Contributing

Due to differences in parameter naming the configuration is separated from the main library. `camera.cpp` contains the base class `Camera` which can be extended to accommodate different cameras. The base class is based on BlackFly S and `cm3.cpp` extends it adding support for Chameleon3. To add a camera create a new derived class of `Camera` and add the model name to the check in `SpinnakerCamera::connect`.

When contributing make sure the travis job suceeds and please use [roscpp_code_format](https://github.com/davetcoleman/roscpp_code_format) to format your code.
